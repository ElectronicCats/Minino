Minino is an original multiprotocol, and multiband board made for sniffing, communicating, and attacking IoT (Internet of Things) devices. It was designed as a mini Cat that integrates the powerful ESP32C6 and a GPS, microSD with OLED.  This board is a mini Swiss army knife for IoT security researchers, developers, and enthusiasts. 

Minino can operate in 6 different technologies:
- BLE (Airtags scanner and SPAM)
- Wi-Fi (Sniffer and deauthenticator)
- Zigbee (Sniffer over CLI and Spoofing)
- Thread
- Matter
- GPS (WarDriving)

## Features
- Compatible with Pycatsniffer of Catsniffer
- Compatible with Wireshark
- WarDriving
- Sniffing multiprotocol
- Support file .pcap in microSD
- File Manager Web
