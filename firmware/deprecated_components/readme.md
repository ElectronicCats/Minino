At the moment, the components you find here on this folder are deprecated because they are not compatible with the esp-idf 5.5.1 version, but at the future they will be updated.

**Included components:**
- Zigbee: Components related to Zigbee (esp-zigbee-console, zigbee_switch, etc.)
- OpenThread: Components related to Thread/OpenThread (openthread, thread_broadcast, etc.)

These components are only available in firmware versions prior to 1.1.13.0.
