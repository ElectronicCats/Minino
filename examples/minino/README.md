# Developer guide

You can build your own firmware using the [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) framework or [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software). However, we will focus on the ESP-IDF framework in this guide.

## Prerequisites

- [Minino](https://electroniccats.com/store/minino/)
- [ESP-IDF](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html) installed
- [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) installed
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) installed (optional but recommended)

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:

Using HTTPS:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ElectronicCats/Minino.git
```

Using SSH:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:ElectronicCats/Minino.git
```

2. Change to the firmware directory:

```bash
cd Minino/examples/minino
```

3. Set the IDF_PATH environment variable:

```bash
get_idf
```

> **Note:** `get_idf` should be an alias you created if you followed the [ESP-IDF installation guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/index.html).

4. Setup the project environment:

```bash
make setup
```

## Building the firmware

To build the firmware, run the following command:

```bash
make compile
```

## Flashing the firmware

1. Connect your Minino to your computer and identify the port it is connected to. For example, `/dev/ttyUSB0` or `/dev/ttyACM0` on Linux, `COM1` or `COM2` on Windows, or `/dev/cu.usbmodem14401` on macOS.

2. Set the PORT to an environment variable, for example:

```bash
export PORT=/dev/ttyUSB0
```

> Replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with the port your Minino is connected to.

3. Flash the firmware:

```bash
make flash
```

## Monitoring the serial output

To monitor the serial output, run the following command:

```bash
make monitor
```

## Full build process

To do all the previous steps in one command, run:

```bash
make all
```

## Cleaning the project

If you you have dependencies issues or want to clean the project, run the following command:

```bash
make clean
```

## Create a release

To create a release, you need to update the firmware version in the `menuconfig`. To do this, run:

```bash
idf.py menuconfig
```

Navigate to `General project` -> `Firmware version` and update the version number.

Get the build files:

```bash
./get_build.sh
```

If you can't run the script, make sure it has the correct permissions:

```bash
chmod +x get_build.sh
```

> **Note:** On Windows, you can run the script using Git Bash.

The build files will be in the `build_files.zip` file. Now you can create a release on GitHub and attach the `build_files.zip` file.
